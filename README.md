[The Valve VR Headset](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-index-review)
VR is one of those technologies that in my opinion will take over the world
soon. I personally think within the next 10 years, VR will be as big as computers
are today, and that perhaps everyone will own one. Whether it's for work related
reasons, or personal reasons, VR seems to be the future. Valve also seem to have
this belief, as they released their own VR set. This VR set is not cheap, unlike the
occulus, but it does come with a lot of perks. You can read the article to know 
more about what it does better/worse than other VR sets, but the point I'm trying to make is
VR is slowly going to become more mainstream, and I'm all here for it.
